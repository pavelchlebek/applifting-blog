# applifting-blog app

- clone this public repo
- run "yarn start" in the root directory
- app should start in default browser on localhost on port 3000

### credentials

userName: "Palisandr"
password: "qwertyui"

## author's solution

- aim was to solve all tasks and subtasks
- working progress was done component by component, screen by screen

## state management

- login information stored using AuthContextProvider.tsx

### possible state management of all articles with all the resources (article details, images, comments) not implemented

- could by done using either Context API (ArticlesProvider) or Redux
- for now I decided not to refactor app to leverage state management of article resources due to already extensive time spent on development
- I am willing to implement state management of article resources on request (part of second round of the tender)
